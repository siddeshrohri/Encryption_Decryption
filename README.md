ENCRYPTION
This Java code showcases a highly secure and efficient file encryption system using the industry-standard Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCS5Padding. The code demonstrates an exemplary implementation of cryptographic best practices, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and robust password management.

Let's look at some of the aspects of this code:-

Strong Random Password Generation:

The code generates a random, cryptographically secure 64-character password, ensuring a high level of security.
The password is derived from an extensive character set encompassing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, making it resistant to brute force attacks.
The code uses a secureRandom object from Java's SecureRandom class ensuring that the password generation is highly randomized and completely unpredictable.

Secure Password Storage:

The generated password is securely stored by writing it to a file named "password.txt."
Passwords are saved as a sequence of bytes using UTF-8 encoding, ensuring no sensitive information is exposed.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Implementation:

The code employs AES encryption, a widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm known for its strong security and performance.
The AES encryption is used in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCS5Padding, enhancing data security by preventing patterns in the encrypted output.

Initialization Vector (IV) Usage:

Each encryption operation uses a unique Initialization Vector (IV) generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator.
The IV is crucial in preventing common weaknesses and enhancing data confidentiality.

Salted Key Derivation:

The code utilizes Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) with HMAC-SHA256 hashing to derive a strong secret key from the user-provided password and a randomly generated salt.
The derived secret key has a length of 256 bits, ensuring high cryptographic strength and resistance to various attacks.

Exception Handling and Clean Code:

The code features robust exception handling, ensuring that any potential errors during encryption are appropriately handled and reported to users.
The code is meticulously organized into well-structured methods, enhancing readability and maintainability.

File Extension Preservation:

The code extracts and preserves the original file extension during encryption, ensuring that decryption is seamless and user-friendly.

User-friendly Interface:

The code provides a user-friendly interface by specifying the input and output file paths and automatically displaying a success message after encryption.

Efficient Encryption Process:

The code reads and encrypts data from the input file in chunks (4096 bytes), optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency.

Industry-Standard Algorithms and Practices:

The code utilizes industry-standard cryptographic algorithms, making it a robust and trustworthy solution for file encryption.
In conclusion, this code impresses with its comprehensive implementation of state-of-the-art cryptographic practices, delivering an advanced and secure file encryption system in Java. Its strong password generation, AES encryption, IV usage, and secure key derivation make it an exemplary model for secure data protection, earning recognition for its performance, reliability, and adherence to cryptographic best practices.
